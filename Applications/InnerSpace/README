These modules are ports of those from the BackSpace days.   It was fairly
easy to get them to work under InnerSpace.app.  

You need to copy these into your home directory 
at GNUstep/Library/InnerSpace after you build them so that InnerSpace can
load them.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
