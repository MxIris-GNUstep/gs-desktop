	GSDefaults is a simple GNUstep defaults database editor. It is aimed
	to be used to read and later even modify defaults entries.

	Remember, this is just a preview! This app was developed within only 
	very few hours, so please do not expect too much, yet.

	GSDefaults is released under the GNU GPL 2.

TODOs
*****

	The defaults are read only for now, editing is therefore not yet 
	possible with this application!

	A better user interface and many other things, probably...
